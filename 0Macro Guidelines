You cannot name a macro starting with a number, or with spaces in the name (you can use an underscore)

Generally, you cannot undo a Macro. Be careful. Save a copy of your data before proceeding.

when you use a macro to repeat some formatting
you can use relative references that allow
to get all the edits on different cells
(it will not be important the cell's position)


In Selection.Find
Selecion is the object
Find is the method

Every object can have differente characteristics like for example Colors, Fonts.
These are called properties

Example
Range(“A1”).Value = “Hello World”

There are several ways to type code in VBA

In this case the following coulde be inteded the same as: Range(“A1”).Value = “Hello World”

Range(“A1”)
Selection.Value = “Hello World”


SAVING IN NORMAL template
In VBA you have the possibility to save your macro inside your file
or inside the 'normal' template.
in the normal template macro will be available in any word or excel file you will open
Modules must be created inside that template to be available
everytime
(you will see it in the left bar Project-Normal)



SHORTCUTS
In order to overcome the impossibilty to set some custom shortcuts, you have to use Macros in Excel.
(In Word customize keyboard is possible.Does not make much sense..)
