F9 to toggle breakpoint (really useful)
It allows to run code until the row indicated by F9

After pressing F9 the row turns red.
The red row will be the last one to be executed.

It will pause the code afterwards.
If you resume the code it will start from the toggle breakpoint (the red row).
To avoid this just press stop debug.
