quickly create another column setting:
if the first column is A and the second one is B:

in another column place this formula:

=A1=B1

it will appear TRUE if both values are the same or FALSE if they are not the same.

then fill it for all the size of the columns

done!

if you want to quickly check the FALSE ones, use conditional formatting
