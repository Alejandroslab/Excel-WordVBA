If you're writing a multi-chapter document, such as a book, that includes figures, you may want to have your figure captions prefaced with the number of the chapter the figure appears in.

To include chapter numbers in captions, you must use a unique heading style for chapter headings. For example, if you use the Heading 1 style for chapter headings, do not use the Heading 1 style for any other text in the document.

Select the first chapter heading in your document.

On the Home tab, in the Paragraph group, click the arrow next to Multilevel List.

Click a chapter-numbering list definition (one that includes the text Heading 1 or Chapter 1).
