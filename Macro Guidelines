You cannot name a macro starting with a number, or with spaces in the name (you can use an underscore)

Generally, you cannot undo a Macro. Be careful

In Selection.Find
Selecion is the object
Find is the method  

Every object can have differente characteristics like for example Colors, Fonts.
These are called properties

Example
Range(“A1”).Value = “Hello World”

There are several ways to type code in VBA

In this case the following coulde be inteded the same as: Range(“A1”).Value = “Hello World”

Range(“A1”) 
Selection.Value = “Hello World”


SHORTCUTS
In order to overcome the impossibilty to set some custom shortcuts, you have to use Macros in Excel.
(In Word customize keyboard is possible.Does not make much sense..)
