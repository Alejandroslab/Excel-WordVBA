1)VBA user-defined type error

to fix this close and reopen Word and everything should be ok

2) sub or function not defined

this could happen when you copy portions of code
from the web

rememebr! you have to clean the code before inserting
in VBA

this means you have to clean all blank spaces

in fact there are very insidious characters
that are invisible inside the editor but VBA will see them and will not run

you can see them also when you paste that kind of
characters inside the search bar of any common browser
(they are sort of squared characters)
